Please be aware that with aurora, If the cluster is idle (no client writes), replication will only see the internal monitoring activity , which occurs roughly every 20 milliseconds. For lack of a better reference, automation will therefore report a  replication lag of ~20ms-25 ms. You can confirm the same by running the query on idle cluster from any node

SELECT server_id, IF(session_id = 'master_session_id', 'writer', 'reader') AS ROLE, replica_lag_in_msec FROM mysql.ro _replica_status;
